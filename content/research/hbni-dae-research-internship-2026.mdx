# HBNI/DAE Research Internship 2026: Eligibility, Stipend, How to Apply, Dates

## Introduction
HBNI connects multiple DAE units (BARC, IGCAR, VECC, etc.) that host interns in nuclear science and engineering. This guide covers 2026 eligibility, stipend, and application flow (Expected/Indicative timelines).

## Program Overview
6–8 week on-site projects in labs or simulation groups. Stipends typically provided; housing support varies by unit. Safety clearances and documentation are mandatory.

## Domains Offered
- Nuclear physics and reactor engineering
- Materials science and metallurgy
- Health physics and radiation safety
- Instrumentation and control

## Eligibility
- Strong physics/engineering background; safety compliance
- SOP aligned to a unit’s ongoing projects

## How to Apply
1) Monitor DAE unit internship notices. 2) Apply with CV, transcript, SOP, and NOC if required. 3) Complete security/safety paperwork promptly.

## FAQs
- Paid? Expected/Indicative: stipend offered; confirm per unit.
- Remote? On-site only.
- Additional checks? ID verification and safety briefings required.
