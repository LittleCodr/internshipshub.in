# Ashoka AISRP Research Internship 2026: Eligibility, Stipend, How to Apply, Dates

## Introduction
Ashoka University’s International Summer Research Programme (AISRP) pairs undergraduates with faculty-led research across sciences, social sciences, humanities, and interdisciplinary themes. This 2026 guide summarizes eligibility, expected timelines, funding expectations, and application steps. Dates marked Expected/Indicative rely on past cycles; confirm on the program site.

## About the Organization / Institute
Ashoka University is a leading liberal arts and sciences university known for research-driven teaching. AISRP offers selective, mentor-led summer projects designed to give undergraduates structured research experience.

## Overview of the Research Internship Programme
AISRP runs ~8–10 weeks in summer. Students work under Ashoka faculty on ongoing projects, attend research discussions, and submit a final output (paper draft, dataset, or presentation). Seats are limited and allocated by faculty fit.

## Research Domains / Areas Offered
- Natural sciences (biology, physics, chemistry, environmental science)
- Computer science and data-intensive projects
- Economics, public policy, and development studies
- Psychology, sociology, anthropology
- Humanities (history, literature, philosophy)
- Interdisciplinary digital humanities and computational social science

## Eligibility Criteria
- Strong CGPA undergraduate students (sophomore/junior level typical).
- Demonstrated research potential (course projects, prior RA roles, or publications).
- Commitment to full-time on-site summer engagement.

## Who Should Apply
Students aiming for research careers or grad school who can show focused interest, prior artifacts (term papers with analysis, code/notebooks, or lab reports), and a clear fit to a faculty’s ongoing work.

## Stipend & Funding
- Expected/Indicative: Limited funding/allowances; some projects may be unfunded. Confirm per 2026 call.
- Accommodation: Campus housing may be offered at cost; check program details.
- Travel: Typically self-funded unless specified.

## Duration & Timeline
- Duration: 8–10 weeks (May–Aug 2026 expected).
- Application deadline: Expected late Feb 2026.
- Offers: Likely in March/April (Expected/Indicative).

## Selection Process
1. Online application with academic records and statement of interest.
2. Faculty review for fit; may request a short task or interview.
3. Offer with project allocation and onboarding details.

## How to Apply (step-by-step)
1. Review AISRP project list/faculty interests; shortlist top fits.
2. Prepare CV, transcript, and a 300–400 word statement linking your skills to specific faculty work.
3. Include 1–2 artifacts (paper, code, or lab report) as evidence.
4. Submit via the official AISRP portal before the deadline.
5. If invited, complete tasks/interviews promptly.
6. On acceptance, confirm housing/travel and finalize project scope with the mentor.

## Documents Required
- CV (one page)
- Transcript
- Statement of interest/proposed contribution
- Sample work (paper/code/report)
- ID proof and photo

## Competition Level / Acceptance Reality
Selective; faculty capacity drives slots. Strong alignment and proof of research execution matter more than generic interest. Humanities/social science candidates should show analytical writing; STEM candidates should show reproducible code/data or lab work.

## Past Year Insights (Expected/Indicative)
- Clear faculty-fit statements outperformed generic motivation letters.
- Prior RA/TA or independent study experience boosted acceptance.
- Housing needed early coordination; campus options were limited.

## FAQs
1) Is AISRP paid?

2) Is housing provided?
Campus housing may be available at cost; confirm in 2026 call.

3) Can international students apply?
Generally yes, subject to program rules; check the official call.

4) Is the program on-site?

5) What makes a strong application?
Faculty fit, clear artifacts (papers/code), and a concise, specific statement.

6) Can I pick multiple projects?
You can indicate preferences; allocation depends on fit and capacity.

7) When are results announced?
Expected March/April; monitor official updates.

8) Are humanities projects included?
Yes—history, literature, philosophy, and allied areas are offered.

## Final Advice for Applicants
Anchor your application to a specific faculty’s current work, attach credible artifacts, and plan for on-site commitment. Sort housing early and respond quickly to faculty queries; fit and execution proof outweigh generic enthusiasm.
