# DST INSPIRE/RISE Research Internship 2026: Eligibility, Stipend, How to Apply, Dates

## Introduction
DST supports student research through INSPIRE (UG/PG) and RISE internships. This guide covers 2026 eligibility, timelines, and how to secure mentor approval. Dates are Expected/Indicative; confirm on the official portal.

## About the Organization / Institute
The Department of Science & Technology funds research and talent programs nationwide. INSPIRE and RISE connect students to approved mentors and labs for summer projects across disciplines.

## Overview of the Research Internship Programme
Internships typically run 6–8 weeks at a host institution. A mentor-backed proposal is central. Outputs include experiments, analyses, and a report. Funding/stipend varies by approval and host.

## Research Domains / Areas Offered
- Physics, materials, photonics
- Chemistry and chemical engineering
- Biological and biomedical sciences
- Earth, atmospheric, and environmental sciences
- Mathematics and computing
- Engineering disciplines supported by mentors

## Eligibility Criteria
- INSPIRE-eligible or registered students (UG/PG) with required marks per scheme
- Mentor/host acceptance and feasible proposal
- Compliance with portal documentation and timelines

## Who Should Apply
Students with prior projects, papers, or lab coursework seeking mentor-led research. Those able to craft a focused, 6–8 week plan aligned with host expertise.

## Stipend & Funding
- Expected/Indicative: Stipend depends on host/approval; some offers are unpaid with certificate.
- Travel and accommodation often self-arranged unless host provides.
- Budget specifics communicated post-approval.

## Duration & Timeline
- Duration: 6–8 weeks (summer window)
- Portal/application: Typically Jan–Feb 2026
- Approvals and onboarding: Mar–Apr 2026

## Selection Process
1. Identify a mentor/lab that matches your domain.
2. Draft a concise proposal (objectives, methods, outputs).
3. Submit on portal with documents.
4. Await mentor/host acceptance and DST approval where applicable.
5. Complete joining formalities and safety protocols.

## How to Apply (step-by-step)
1. Shortlist mentors/labs from prior INSPIRE/RISE host lists or department pages.
2. Build a 1–2 page proposal with milestones for 6–8 weeks.
3. Prepare CV, transcript, and evidence (posters, code, datasets, lab logs).
4. Apply via online portal (https://online-inspire.gov.in) per scheme timeline.
5. Follow up with mentors after submission to confirm capacity.
6. Arrange accommodation and travel upon acceptance.

## Documents Required
- CV (one page)
- Transcript/mark sheets meeting scheme thresholds
- Proposal with objectives and methods
- ID proof, photo
- Any scheme-specific declarations

## Competition Level / Acceptance Reality
Selective; mentor bandwidth and proposal quality decide. Generic requests are rejected; targeted proposals and prior work improve acceptance.

## Past Year Insights (Expected/Indicative)
- Fast, specific proposals received quicker mentor confirmations.
- Labs preferred students with safety training or prior lab work.
- Accommodation remained a constraint; early booking helped.

## FAQs
1) Is the internship paid?
Expected/Indicative: Stipend depends on host/approval; some offers are unpaid with certificate.

2) Can I apply without a mentor?
You need a willing mentor/host; identify one before or during application.

3) What CGPA is needed?
As per INSPIRE/RISE thresholds; strong academics and artifacts help.

4) Can I switch mentors after applying?
Rare; apply with the mentor you intend to work with.

5) Are travel and stay covered?
Often self-funded unless host provides support.

6) Can projects be remote?
Generally on-site; remote only if a host explicitly permits.

7) Can I extend beyond 8 weeks?
Possible with mentor and scheme approval.

8) What makes a strong proposal?
Clear objectives, feasible methods, measurable outputs, and lab alignment.

## Final Advice for Applicants
Secure a mentor early, craft a concise proposal, and align with host expertise. Keep communication professional and evidence-driven; arrange logistics early.
