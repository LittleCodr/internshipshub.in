# CSIR Summer Research Training Programme 2026: Eligibility, Stipend, How to Apply, Dates

## Introduction
CSIR’s Summer Research Training Programme (SRTP) places students into domain-specific projects across CSIR labs such as CFTRI (food), CLRI (leather), CSMCRI (chem/marine), IICB (biomedical), NPL (physics), CCMB (molecular biology), and IMTECH (microbiology/biotech). This 2026 guide outlines expected timelines, eligibility, how to target the right lab, and how to package your application. Dates marked Expected/Indicative are based on recent cycles; verify with the official call.

## About the Organization / Institute
The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research runs a national network of labs spanning life sciences, chemicals, materials, physics, earth sciences, and engineering. Each lab drives mission-oriented research with industry and government partners. SRTP is a flagship intake for students to work on ongoing projects under CSIR scientists.

## Overview of the Research Internship Programme
SRTP is a 6–8 week on-site internship. Labs publish calls or accept nominations; capacity is tied to mentor availability and safety constraints. Interns receive a project charter, work under a scientist mentor, and deliver a report/presentation. Some labs also host non-SRTP project trainees; SRTP remains the main structured route.

## Research Domains / Areas Offered
- Life sciences and molecular biology (CCMB, IICB, IMTECH)
- Chemistry, catalysis, marine sciences (CSMCRI)
- Materials, physics, metrology (NPL)
- Food science and nutrition (CFTRI)
- Leather science and materials (CLRI)
- Data/AI applications for lab workflows (several labs)
- Environmental science, water/air quality (select labs)

## Eligibility Criteria
- Enrollment: 3rd/4th year UG or PG in relevant disciplines.
- CGPA: Competitive; 7.5–8.0+ typical among prior selectees (Expected/Indicative).
- Prerequisites: Domain coursework and at least one relevant project (wet lab, simulation, or data).
- Documents: NOC/request letter often required; lab-specific formats may apply.

## Who Should Apply
Students with clear domain intent and evidence—lab notebooks, code repos, simulation reports, or published abstracts. Fit improves when you target a lab whose recent papers or patents align with your skills. Avoid generic “any project” applications.

## Stipend & Funding
- Expected/Indicative: Mostly certificate-only; a few labs may offer stipends.
- Accommodation: Limited hostel/guest house; often self-arranged.
- Travel: Usually not covered.

## Duration & Timeline
- Duration: 6–8 weeks (summer window mid-May to mid-July).
- Application window: Jan–early Mar 2026 (Expected/Indicative).
- Confirmations: Rolling; tied to mentor bandwidth.

## Selection Process
1. Apply via SRTP portal or lab-specific call with CV, transcript, and intent.
2. Screening on CGPA, domain fit, and available projects.
3. Acceptance email with reporting and lab safety instructions.
4. Onboarding and project scoping in week one.

## How to Apply (step-by-step)
1. Choose 2–3 labs that match your domain (e.g., CCMB for molecular, NPL for physics/metrology).
2. Prepare CV, transcript, and a 200–250 word lab-specific SOP with a proposed deliverable.
3. Obtain university NOC if required.
4. Apply through SRTP portal or the lab’s internship email as per the call; attach documents.
5. Follow up once after 7–10 days with a concise update or small artifact.
6. After acceptance, complete any safety/ID formalities.

## Documents Required
- CV (one page, domain metrics)
- Transcript
- Lab-specific SOP (problem + deliverable)
- NOC/request letter (if required)
- ID proof and photo
- Any lab safety/IT compliance forms

## Competition Level / Acceptance Reality
Highly competitive; labs prefer candidates with proven domain skills and readiness for on-site lab work. Early, focused applications outperform broad blasts. Safety and lab capacity can limit seats.

## Past Year Insights (Expected/Indicative)
- Wet-lab heavy institutes (CCMB/IICB/IMTECH) prioritized prior bench exposure and safety compliance.
- Data/AI angles helped candidates at labs modernizing analytics (NPL, CFTRI).
- Accommodation scarcity made early planning essential.

## FAQs
1) Is CSIR SRTP paid?
Expected/Indicative: Mostly certificate-only; limited stipends vary by lab.

2) Can I pick any CSIR lab?
Yes, but selection depends on mentor capacity and fit; tailor to 1–2 labs.

3) Are internships remote?
No, these are on-site due to lab work.

4) What CGPA helps?
7.5–8.0+ is common among selectees; strong projects can offset slightly lower scores.

5) Is NOC mandatory?
Often yes; check the call and keep a signed NOC ready.

6) Do I contact mentors directly?
Follow the official call. Unsolicited emails can work only if the lab allows them.

7) How long is the program?
Typically 6–8 weeks in summer.

8) Can I extend the internship?
Possible if the mentor agrees and paperwork is cleared; plan upfront.

## Final Advice for Applicants
Target a lab, show domain artifacts, and align to its recent work. Prepare NOC early, respect lab safety rules, and secure accommodation near the lab. A sharp SOP with a defined 6–8 week deliverable beats broad interest statements.
