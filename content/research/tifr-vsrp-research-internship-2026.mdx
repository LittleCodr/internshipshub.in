# TIFR VSRP Research Internship 2026: Eligibility, Stipend, How to Apply, Dates

## Introduction
TIFR’s Visiting Students Research Programme (VSRP) is a selective on-site research internship that immerses students in labs across physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and computer science. This guide summarizes eligibility, stipend, and how to apply. Dates marked Expected/Indicative mirror prior cycles until the official notice posts.

## About the Organization / Institute
TIFR is India’s premier basic science institute with campuses in Mumbai and centers nationwide. VSRP interns work with faculty on active research problems, gaining exposure to advanced labs and theory groups.

## Overview of the Research Internship Programme
VSRP runs ~6–8 weeks on-site. Interns receive a stipend, possible travel support, and housing assistance. Workstreams include literature review, experiments/simulations, and a final presentation/report.

## Research Domains / Areas Offered
- Physics (theory and experimental)
- Chemistry (physical, inorganic, organic)
- Biology (molecular, cellular, neuroscience)
- Mathematics
- Computer Science and computational sciences

## Eligibility Criteria
- High CGPA and strong fundamentals in the chosen domain
- Pre-final/final year UG or early PG students
- Fit to a faculty mentor’s ongoing work; SOP should reflect specific interests

## Who Should Apply
Students with demonstrated research aptitude: course projects, small papers/posters, simulations, or code relevant to the target group. Strong math maturity and clear communication help during screening.

## Stipend & Funding
- Paid; modest monthly stipend + travel support (Expected/Indicative based on prior VSRP cycles)
- Hostel/guest house support typically provided or facilitated
- No application fee

## Duration & Timeline (Expected/Indicative)
- Applications: by 2026-01-31
- Shortlist/mentor mapping: Feb–Mar 2026
- Joining: ~2026-05-15
- Program end: ~2026-07-15

## Selection Process
1. Online application with SOP, resume, and academic details.
2. Faculty review for domain fit; some applicants may get short tasks or interviews.
3. Offer and logistics (travel/hostel) coordination.

## How to Apply (step-by-step)
1. Review TIFR research groups; shortlist labs aligned to your background.
2. Prepare a focused SOP (200–300 words) citing specific faculty/group work.
3. Attach CV, transcripts, and any publications/posters or repos.
4. Submit via the official VSRP portal before the deadline.
5. Respond quickly to any follow-up or task from faculty.

## Documents Required
- CV (one page)

- Recommendation letters if requested
- ID proof, photo

## Competition Level / Acceptance Reality
Highly selective; acceptance rates are low and vary by group. Domain alignment and evidence of prior work significantly improve chances.

## Past Year Insights (Expected/Indicative)
- Strong math and coding skills boosted CS/physics selections.
- Biology/chemistry labs valued prior lab courses and safety training.
- Quick, thoughtful responses to faculty emails improved conversion.

## FAQs
1) Is VSRP paid?
Yes, a modest stipend is offered with possible travel support (Expected/Indicative; check official notice).

2) Is housing provided?
Hostel/guest house assistance is typically arranged; confirm in your offer.

3) Can international students apply?

5) What CGPA helps?
High CGPA with strong subject fundamentals; no official cutoff published.

6) Are recommendation letters required?
May be requested; keep one ready from faculty who know your work.

7) Are projects theory or experimental?
Both, depending on group; read recent papers to tailor your SOP.

8) Can the internship extend?
Possible if the mentor invites you to continue as a project student or RA.

## Final Advice for Applicants
Anchor your SOP to specific faculty and recent papers, keep artifacts ready, and respond fast to any tasks. Plan travel and housing early once selected; be prepared for full-time on-site work.
