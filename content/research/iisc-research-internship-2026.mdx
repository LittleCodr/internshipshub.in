# IISc Research Internship 2026: Eligibility, Stipend, How to Apply, Dates

## Introduction
IISc research internships place students in leading labs across science and engineering. This guide outlines eligibility, expected timelines, funding reality, and application steps for 2026. Dates are Expected/Indicative; check the target department’s notice.

## About the Organization / Institute
Indian Institute of Science is India’s premier research university. Labs span physics, chemistry, biology, materials, engineering, and computation. Interns work with faculty or senior researchers on scoped projects.

## Overview of the Research Internship Programme
Engagements are typically 8–12 weeks, on-site in Bengaluru. Selection depends on mentor availability and domain fit. Outcomes include a project report/presentation; some labs offer project trainee roles with longer spans.

## Research Domains / Areas Offered
- Physics, materials, and nanoscience
- Chemistry and chemical engineering
- Biology, bioengineering, and computational biology
- Computer science, AI/ML, systems
- Electrical/electronics: communications, signal processing, controls
- Mechanical/aerospace: fluid/structures, robotics

## Eligibility Criteria
- 3rd/4th year UG or PG in relevant fields
- Strong CGPA (Expected/Indicative: 7.5–8.0+)
- Domain projects aligned to the host lab
- On-site availability for full duration

## Who Should Apply
Students with clear domain portfolios—code, experiments, simulations, or papers—mapped to a specific lab. Generic resumes perform poorly; lab-aligned artifacts and concise intent letters win.

## Stipend & Funding
- Expected/Indicative: Limited funded seats; many are certificate-only.
- Accommodation: Campus/hostel options are limited; plan early.
- Travel: Usually self-funded.

## Duration & Timeline
- Duration: 8–12 weeks (May–Aug window)
- Application window: Jan–early Mar 2026 (varies by department)
- Confirmations: Rolling, mentor-dependent

## Selection Process
1. Identify target labs; review recent papers.
2. Send CV, transcript, and a lab-specific statement to faculty/department per instructions.
3. Some labs require NOC/official letters.
4. Shortlisting and possible quick task/interview.
5. Acceptance with joining and access steps.

## How to Apply (step-by-step)
1. Pick 2–3 labs; map your artifacts to their current work.
2. Draft a 200–300 word SOP with proposed 8–12 week deliverable.
3. Prepare CV, transcript, and links to code/data/papers.
4. Email faculty/department or use official portal if available.
5. Follow up once after 7–10 days with a small improvement.
6. On acceptance, complete ID/NOC and plan accommodation.

## Documents Required
- CV (one page)
- Transcript
- Lab-specific SOP/proposal
- NOC/request letter if asked
- ID proof, photo

## Competition Level / Acceptance Reality
Selective; lab bandwidth is the limiter. Domain fit and proof of execution matter more than generic interest. Early, precise outreach wins.

## Past Year Insights (Expected/Indicative)
- Labs favored candidates referencing recent publications.
- Reproducible code/experiments improved responses.
- Hostel availability was tight; many arranged private stays.

## FAQs
1) Is the internship paid?
Expected/Indicative: Limited stipends; many roles are certificate-only.

2) Is remote allowed?
Generally no; on-site preferred for lab access.

3) What CGPA helps?
7.5–8.0+ common among selectees; strong projects can offset.

4) Do I need a NOC?
Some departments request it; keep one ready.

5) Can I contact faculty directly?
Yes, if the department permits; stay concise and lab-specific.

6) How long is the program?
8–12 weeks typical.

7) Is accommodation provided?
Limited; plan early for private options if needed.

8) Can the stint be extended?
Possible with mentor approval and admin clearance.

## Final Advice for Applicants
Lead with lab-fit, show evidence, and apply early. Prepare NOC, plan housing, and send concise follow-ups with real improvements.
