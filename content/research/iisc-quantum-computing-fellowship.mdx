## Fellowship mission

- Advance open quantum system simulations with IISc's superconducting qubit labs.
- Publish in top-tier journals with joint authorship from faculty mentors.
- Prototype algorithms for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

## Program structure

1. Orientation and project scoping with the Centre for Quantum Technology.
2. Lab rotations across hardware fabrication, control systems, and theoretical modeling.
3. Final symposium showcasing research outcomes to industry partners and government labs.

## Application package

- Curriculum vitae highlighting research experience.
- Statement of purpose describing your quantum computing interests.
- Two letters of recommendation from academic supervisors.

Selected fellows receive on-campus accommodation assistance and seed grants to attend international quantum computing conferences.
