# DRDO Research Internship 2026: Eligibility, Stipend, How to Apply, Dates

## Introduction
DRDO’s student internship and project training scheme places learners inside defence R&D labs working on avionics, propulsion, communications, AI/ML, materials, and test engineering. This guide explains eligibility, timelines, and how to approach specific labs with targeted portfolios. Dates marked Expected/Indicative draw from prior cycles; verify with the target lab’s latest circular.

## About the Organization / Institute
The Defence Research and Development Organisation leads India’s defence technology programs across missiles, radars, EW, AI, materials, and unmanned systems. Over 50 labs specialize in domains like aeronautics (ADE), missiles (ASL, RCI), electronics (LRDE, DLRL), materials (DRDL, DMRL), and naval systems (NSTL). Interns join lab teams for scoped project work under scientist mentors.

## Overview of the Research Internship Programme
Labs host short-term interns for 6–8 week projects or semester-long training. Selection depends on mentor availability, security clearance, and domain alignment. Engagements are on-site with restricted network access; deliverables usually include a report and demo aligned to lab objectives. University nomination or project training requests are commonly required.

## Research Domains / Areas Offered
- Avionics, guidance, navigation, and control
- RF systems, radar signal processing, EW/ECM/ECCM
- Embedded systems, real-time software, and secure comms
- AI/ML for perception, tracking, and decision support
- Structural analysis, propulsion components, and materials
- Computational fluid dynamics and aero design
- Naval hydrodynamics and undersea systems (NSTL)
- Sensors, IR/EO systems, and data fusion

## Eligibility Criteria
- Enrollment: 3rd/4th year UG or PG in relevant disciplines; Indian citizenship mandatory.
- CGPA: Competitive; 7.5–8.0+ is common in prior selections.
- Background: Domain-aligned courses and projects; ability to work on-site with security compliance.
- University documents: NOC/request letter often required; some labs need a faculty coordinator.

## Who Should Apply
Students with proof of execution—signal-processing notebooks, embedded prototypes, control simulations, or ML models tied to defence-like workloads. Clear alignment to a specific lab (e.g., radar -> LRDE, missiles -> ASL/RCI, materials -> DMRL) is critical. Generic resumes seldom succeed.

## Stipend & Funding
- Expected/Indicative: Some labs provide stipends; many roles are certificate-only.
- Accommodation: Not guaranteed; arrange near the lab. Some campuses have limited hostel/guest house options.
- Travel: Usually self-funded unless a specific program states otherwise.

## Duration & Timeline
- Typical duration: 6–8 weeks (summer); semester projects possible if approved.
- Application window: Jan–early Mar 2026 (Expected/Indicative), lab-specific.
- Confirmations: Rolling; faster for clearly aligned candidates with complete documents.

## Selection Process
1. Submit request via lab email/portal with NOC and documents.
2. Lab screens CGPA, project fit, and citizenship.
3. Mentor shortlists and issues acceptance; may request a quick technical task.
4. Complete security/ID formalities; report on-site.

## How to Apply (step-by-step)
1. Pick 2–3 labs whose current work matches your portfolio.
2. Prepare CV, transcript, 200–250 word lab-specific SOP, and NOC/request letter.
3. Email the lab’s internship/training contact (per lab site) with subject: “Student Internship – [Domain] – [College] – Summer 2026”.
4. Attach artifacts (code links, schematics, brief slides); keep email concise.
5. Follow up once after 7–10 days with a small improvement (e.g., refined plot or prototype snapshot).
6. On acceptance, submit ID proofs and comply with security instructions.

## Documents Required
- CV (one page, domain metrics)
- Transcript
- SOP tailored to target lab
- NOC/request letter from university
- ID proof, passport photo
- Any lab-issued security/IT compliance forms

## Competition Level / Acceptance Reality
Highly selective; mentor bandwidth and security drive approvals. Labs prefer fewer, better-aligned interns over volume. Demonstrable, domain-specific work matters more than generic academic scores alone.

## Past Year Insights (Expected/Indicative)
- Labs prioritized on-site availability and security compliance.
- Radar/comm labs favored candidates with DSP/ML notebooks; missile/aero labs preferred controls/structures simulations.
- Early, specific outreach with NOC attached saw higher response rates.

## FAQs
1) Is the DRDO internship paid?
Expected/Indicative: Some labs provide stipends; many are certificate-only.

2) Do I need to be an Indian citizen?
Yes. DRDO internships require Indian citizenship.

3) Is remote work allowed?
No. Internships are on-site due to security.

4) What CGPA is competitive?
7.5–8.0+ is common among prior selectees.

5) Do all labs accept interns?
No; it depends on mentor bandwidth and project security. Check lab notices.

6) Are semester-long projects possible?
Yes, if a mentor agrees and documents are complete.

7) What makes an application strong?
Domain-aligned artifacts, concise SOP, NOC attached, and clear lab fit.

8) Is accommodation provided?
Often not; plan private stays unless a lab explicitly offers hostel/guest house slots.

## Final Advice for Applicants
Target specific labs, lead with domain proof, and include NOC up front. Respect security/IT instructions, prepare for on-site only, and keep follow-ups concise with tangible improvements.
