# JNCASR Summer Research Fellowship Programme 2026: Eligibility, Stipend, How to Apply, Dates

## Introduction
The JNCASR Summer Research Fellowship Programme (SRFP) is one of India’s most selective research internships, pairing students with JNCASR faculty across physics, chemistry, biology, materials, and engineering sciences. This guide outlines 2026 eligibility, expected timelines, stipend norms (indicative), and application steps. Dates marked Expected/Indicative reflect prior cycles—always confirm on the official portal.

## About the Organization / Institute
JNCASR is an autonomous institute under the Department of Science and Technology, renowned for fundamental and interdisciplinary research. SRFP fellows join active labs, contribute to ongoing projects, and receive mentorship oriented toward publications and research careers.

## Overview of the Research Internship Programme
SRFP typically runs for ~8 weeks in summer. Fellows are assigned to mentors based on domain fit, proposal quality, and capacity. The program emphasizes hands-on experimentation or computation, regular progress reviews, and a final report/presentation.

## Research Domains / Areas Offered
- Condensed matter and materials science
- Chemistry and chemical biology
- Molecular biology and genetics
- Theoretical and experimental physics
- Engineering sciences and interdisciplinary programs

## Eligibility Criteria
- Outstanding UG/PG students in science/engineering/medicine disciplines.
- Strong CGPA and evidence of research aptitude (projects, papers, competitions).
- Commitment to full on-site engagement during the program window.

## Who Should Apply
Students planning research careers (MS/PhD) with clear domain focus, prior project artifacts, and the ability to articulate a feasible 8-week plan. A concise proposal aligned to JNCASR lab themes is essential.

## Stipend & Funding
- Expected/Indicative: Fellowship stipend and travel support as per SRFP norms (refer to official call).
- Accommodation: Historically provided/assisted for selected fellows; confirm per 2026 circular.
- Travel: Often reimbursed/assisted; verify official terms.

## Duration & Timeline
- Duration: ~8 weeks (May–July 2026).
- Application deadline: Expected around late Jan 2026; monitor official dates.
- Results: Typically announced before April (Expected/Indicative).

## Selection Process
1. Online application with academic details and statement of purpose.
2. Evaluation of CGPA, recommendations, domain fit, and proposed work.
3. Allocation to a faculty mentor and lab, subject to capacity.
4. Offer communication with joining instructions.

## How to Apply (step-by-step)
1. Review JNCASR research areas and identify 2–3 matching labs.
2. Prepare transcripts, CV, and a crisp 300–400 word proposal highlighting problem, methods, and expected outcomes.
3. Obtain recommendations as required by the portal.
4. Submit via the official SRFP application link before the deadline.
5. Track status; respond promptly to any document requests.
6. On selection, confirm availability and complete accommodation/logistics steps.

## Documents Required
- CV (one page, research-focused)
- Academic transcripts
- Statement of purpose/proposal (domain-aligned)
- Recommendation letters (as required)
- ID proof and photo

## Competition Level / Acceptance Reality
Extremely selective; acceptance rates are low. Domain clarity, proposal quality, and academic strength drive outcomes. Generic applications rarely succeed.

## Past Year Insights (Expected/Indicative)
- Proposals tied to active lab themes performed better.
- Prior research artifacts (posters, code, preprints) boosted odds.
- Accommodation was facilitated for selected fellows; confirm for 2026.
