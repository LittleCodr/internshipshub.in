# IIRS Research Internship 2026: Eligibility, Stipend, How to Apply, Dates

## Introduction
The Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS), part of ISRO, hosts research interns on remote sensing, GIS, photogrammetry, and geospatial analytics projects. This 2026 guide summarizes eligibility, timelines, and application steps, with Expected/Indicative dates based on recent cycles.

## About the Organization / Institute
IIRS advances remote sensing, GIS, and related geospatial technologies for national missions and capacity building. Interns engage with scientists on EO data processing, applications for water/agriculture/urban domains, and emerging ML/AI methods for imagery.

## Overview of the Research Internship Programme
Internships are on-site in Dehradun, typically 6–8 weeks. Projects are mentor-led, with deliverables such as processed datasets, analysis reports, or prototype tools. Selection hinges on domain fit and demonstrated geospatial skills.

## Research Domains / Areas Offered
- Optical/SAR data processing and analytics
- GIS and geospatial databases
- Photogrammetry and 3D modeling
- ML/AI for earth observation
- Applications: agriculture, hydrology, urban, disaster management

## Eligibility Criteria
- Enrollment: 3rd/4th year UG or PG in geo-informatics, civil/geo, CS/AI/data, environmental domains.
- CGPA: Competitive; strong project evidence expected.
- Skills: RS/GIS fundamentals, coding/analysis in Python/GEE/QGIS/ArcGIS.

## Who Should Apply
Students with hands-on RS/GIS projects, EO data notebooks, or geospatial apps. Clear domain focus (e.g., SAR flood mapping, land-cover classification, DEM analytics) helps significantly.

## Stipend & Funding
- Expected/Indicative: Mostly certificate-only; stipends depend on specific IIRS calls.
- Accommodation: Limited hostel/guest house possibilities; plan early.
- Travel: Generally self-funded.

## Duration & Timeline
- Duration: 6–8 weeks (mid-May to mid-July typical).
- Application window: Jan–early Mar 2026 (Expected/Indicative).
- Confirmations: Rolling, subject to mentor bandwidth.

## Selection Process
1. Apply via IIRS call/portal with CV, transcript, and intent.
2. Screening on CGPA, RS/GIS portfolio, and mentor availability.
3. Acceptance with reporting and lab/IT instructions.
4. Onboarding and project scoping.

## How to Apply (step-by-step)
1. Pick a focus (e.g., SAR change detection, crop monitoring, urban growth analysis).
2. Prepare CV, transcript, and a 200–250 word SOP stating proposed deliverable.
3. Include links to EO notebooks/apps and data handling proof.
4. Submit via IIRS internship channel before the deadline.
5. Follow up once after 7–10 days with a brief improvement (refined map/classification accuracy).
6. On selection, complete ID and access formalities; arrange accommodation.

## Documents Required
- CV (one page, geo/RS metrics)
- Transcript
- SOP with proposed project
- Portfolio links (notebooks, apps, repos)
- NOC if requested
- ID proof and photo

## Competition Level / Acceptance Reality
Selective; strong portfolios in RS/GIS and ability to work on-site are decisive. Generic resumes without geospatial artifacts rarely succeed.

## Past Year Insights (Expected/Indicative)
- ML/AI for EO gained traction; reproducible notebooks were favored.
- SAR/optical fusion projects were popular for disaster and agri use-cases.
- Accommodation needed early planning; guest house slots were limited.

## FAQs
1) Is the IIRS internship paid?
Expected/Indicative: Mostly certificate-only; stipends depend on specific calls.

2) Is remote work allowed?
No. Internships are on-site in Dehradun.

3) What CGPA is competitive?
Strong CGPA with RS/GIS artifacts; portfolio matters more than a single number.

4) Which tools should I know?
Python, QGIS/ArcGIS, Google Earth Engine, and EO data handling.

5) Is accommodation provided?
Limited; check the call and plan early.

6) Can I propose my own topic?
Yes, if aligned to IIRS domains and mentor interest.

7) How long is the internship?
6–8 weeks typical in summer.

8) Do I need a NOC?
May be required; keep one ready per IIRS instructions.

## Final Advice for Applicants
Lead with geospatial proof—maps, notebooks, classification metrics. Keep SOP concise, focused on one domain outcome, and be ready for full on-site work. Secure accommodation early and follow instructions precisely.
