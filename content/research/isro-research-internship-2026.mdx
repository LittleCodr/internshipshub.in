# ISRO Research Internship 2026: Eligibility, Stipend, How to Apply, Dates

## Introduction
ISRO research internships expose students to national space missions, embedded systems, remote sensing payloads, and data processing pipelines. This guide consolidates how centres like VSSC, URSC, SAC, NRSC, ISTRAC, LPSC, IPRC, and SDSC handle applications, what timelines to expect for summer 2026, and how to prepare a portfolio that survives technical screening. Any dates marked Expected/Indicative mirror prior-year cycles; confirm with the hosting centre’s latest circular.

## About the Organization / Institute
The Indian Space Research Organisation leads India’s launch vehicles, spacecraft, earth observation, and deep-space missions. Each centre runs specific mandates—VSSC (launch vehicles), URSC (satellites), SAC/NRSC (payloads and data), ISTRAC (tracking), LPSC/IPRC (propulsion), SDSC (launch ops). Interns typically join engineering or science divisions aligned to ongoing missions or technology development.

## Overview of the Research Internship Programme
ISRO offers short-term project training and internships for students nominated by their universities or selected through centre-level calls. Engagements are on-site, supervised by a scientist/engineer, and culminate in a project report or demo. Slots are limited and tied to mentor availability; some centres require an official request letter from the university’s Head of Department.

## Research Domains / Areas Offered
- Launch vehicle systems (structures, propulsion, avionics)
- Satellite bus subsystems (power, thermal, AOCS)
- RF systems, antennas, and communications
- Remote sensing and image processing (SAC, NRSC)
- Onboard software, fault tolerance, and FDIR
- Guidance, navigation, and control (GNC)
- Materials, composites, and additive manufacturing
- Propulsion test analytics (LPSC/IPRC)
- Tracking, telemetry, and command (ISTRAC)
- Space applications: disaster management, agriculture, urban planning

## Eligibility Criteria
- Enrollment: 3rd/4th year B.Tech/B.E. or PG students in relevant disciplines.
- CGPA: Competitive; centres often expect 7.5–8.0+ (Expected/Indicative).
- Prerequisites: Core courses (controls, signals, RF, materials, thermo) and evidence of applied projects.
- Nomination: Many centres need an official request/NOC from the university.
- Citizenship: Primarily Indian citizens; exceptions are rare and centre-controlled.

## Who Should Apply
Students with focused project portfolios (simulation + hardware or code + data) and evidence of disciplined documentation. Strong fits show:
- Domain alignment (e.g., GNC candidates with control projects, payload candidates with RF or image-processing work).
- Reproducible repos, schematics, or analyses instead of generic resumes.
- Ability to be on-site for the full duration; remote is uncommon.

## Stipend & Funding
- Expected/Indicative: Some centres provide modest stipends; many are certificate-only.
- Accommodation: Usually self-arranged; limited hostel/guest house options may exist near certain centres.
- Travel: Typically not reimbursed; budget personally unless specified in centre circulars.

## Duration & Timeline
- Typical duration: 6–8 weeks (summer window mid-May to mid-July).
- Application window: Jan–Feb 2026 (Expected/Indicative) via university nomination or centre portal/email.
- Confirmations: Rolling based on mentor availability; earlier outreach improves odds.

## Selection Process
1. University nomination or direct application per centre instructions.
2. Screening on CGPA, project relevance, and mentor bandwidth.
3. Email confirmation with reporting instructions and any security/ID requirements.
4. Onboarding on-site; project scoping in week one.

## How to Apply (step-by-step)
1. Identify the target centre and division (e.g., VSSC structures, SAC payload data, URSC bus software).
2. Prepare a 1-page CV, transcripts, and a 200–250 word statement on the specific problem you want to tackle.
3. Obtain a university request letter/NOC if required.
4. Send the application to the official centre internship email or portal, attaching documents and preferred dates.
5. Follow up once after 7–10 days with an updated artifact or relevant mini-study.
6. Upon acceptance, submit ID proofs and comply with visitor/access protocols.

## Documents Required
- CV (concise, project-focused)
- Transcripts with core course grades
- Statement of purpose (problem and expected deliverable)
- University request letter/NOC (centre-dependent)
- ID proof and passport-size photograph
- Any NDA/security forms issued by the centre

## Competition Level / Acceptance Reality
Slots are limited and depend on mentor availability; popular domains (GNC, payload data, software) are highly selective. Early, targeted outreach with domain proof strongly outperforms generic requests. Certificate-only nature means funding isn’t the primary filter—fit and security clearance are.

## Past Year Insights (Expected/Indicative)
- VSSC and URSC historically prioritized on-site availability and domain-fit portfolios.
- SAC/NRSC favored candidates with image/RF signal processing and reproducible notebooks.
- Guest house access was scarce; students arranged private accommodation near centres.
- Quick responses to document requests improved onboarding speed.

## FAQs
1) Is the ISRO internship paid?
Expected/Indicative: Some centres offer modest stipends; many are certificate-only.

2) Can I apply without a university NOC?
Most centres require a formal request letter; confirm with the target centre before applying.

3) Are internships remote?
No. ISRO internships are on-site due to lab and security protocols.

4) What CGPA is competitive?
7.5–8.0+ is common among selectees; strong projects can offset slightly lower CGPA.

5) Which centres are most accessible?
Centre access depends on mentors. Payload data roles at SAC/NRSC and software roles at URSC often see more student projects.

6) How long is the internship?
Typically 6–8 weeks in summer; some project-training slots can be longer if approved.

7) Can international students apply?
Generally no; ISRO internships are primarily for Indian citizens, with rare exceptions.

8) What deliverable is expected?
A scoped project report/demo tied to the hosting division, plus adherence to centre documentation norms.

## Final Advice for Applicants
Lead with specific division-fit, show reproducible work, and secure university approvals early. Keep accommodation and travel plans ready since confirmations can be close to start dates. Follow instructions precisely—security and documentation rigor are non-negotiable.
