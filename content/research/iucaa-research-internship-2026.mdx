# IUCAA Research Internship 2026: Eligibility, Stipend, How to Apply, Dates

## Introduction
IUCAA runs selective summer projects in astrophysics, cosmology, and related computation. This 2026 guide covers eligibility, domains, stipend, and how to apply. Dates are Expected/Indicative.

## Program Overview
6–8 weeks on-site in Pune with faculty mentors. Work includes simulations, data analysis, theory calculations, and a final seminar/report. Stipend and hostel support are typically offered.

## Research Domains / Areas Offered
- Cosmology and large-scale structure
- Gravitation and gravitational waves
- High-energy astrophysics
- Instrumentation and data pipelines

## Eligibility Criteria
- Strong physics/math background; coding proficiency
- Pre-final/final year UG or early PG
- SOP aligned to a faculty’s current work

## How to Apply (step-by-step)
1) Review IUCAA research groups and papers. 2) Draft a 200–300 word SOP with a feasible 6–8 week objective. 3) Apply via IUCAA call/portal with CV and transcripts. 4) Respond quickly to any follow-up.

## FAQs
- Paid? Expected/Indicative: modest stipend; hostel support. 
- Remote? On-site only. 
- CGPA cutoff? High CGPA preferred; alignment matters more. 
- Can it extend? Possible via faculty invitation to longer projects.
