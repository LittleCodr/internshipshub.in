# ICAR Research Internship 2026: Eligibility, Stipend, How to Apply, Dates

## Introduction
ICAR institutes host research interns on crop science, animal science, food technology, agri-engineering, and data-driven agriculture. This 2026 guide summarizes eligibility, domains, and application steps. Dates are Expected/Indicative; check the target institute’s circular.

## About the Organization / Institute
The Indian Council of Agricultural Research oversees national agricultural research and education. Its institutes (e.g., IARI, IVRI, CIFE, NDRI) run lab and field programs aligned to food security, animal health, and agri innovation.

## Overview of the Research Internship Programme
Internships run 6–10 weeks on-site. Selection is institute- and mentor-dependent. Deliverables include field/lab data, analysis, and a report/presentation. Some institutes run formal student training calls; others accept faculty-nominated interns.

## Research Domains / Areas Offered
- Crop improvement, physiology, and breeding
- Plant pathology, entomology, and protection
- Soil science, water management, and climate resilience
- Animal health, dairy science, fisheries
- Food technology, post-harvest, and nutrition
- Agri-engineering, sensors, robotics
- Data/AI for precision agriculture and remote sensing

## Eligibility Criteria
- 3rd/4th year UG or PG in agri/life sciences/engg
- CGPA competitive (Expected/Indicative: 7.0–8.0+)
- Domain-fit projects or field/lab exposure
- On-site availability; institute rules apply

## Who Should Apply
Students with field/lab logs, assays, prototypes, or data analytics linked to agriculture. Specific institute alignment (e.g., dairy -> NDRI, fisheries -> CIFE) improves odds.

## Stipend & Funding
- Expected/Indicative: Some institutes offer stipends; many are certificate-only.
- Accommodation: Limited hostel/guest house; plan early.
- Travel: Typically self-funded.

## Duration & Timeline
- Duration: 6–10 weeks (May–July window)
- Application window: Jan–early Mar 2026 (varies by institute)
- Confirmations: Rolling, mentor-dependent

## Selection Process
1. Identify institute and division matching your domain.
2. Prepare CV, transcript, domain SOP, and artifacts.
3. Apply via institute call/portal or faculty email with NOC if required.
4. Shortlisting, possible quick task, then acceptance.
5. Complete ID/safety paperwork and report on-site.

## How to Apply (step-by-step)
1. Shortlist 1–2 institutes based on domain.
2. Draft a 200–250 word SOP with a feasible 6–10 week deliverable.
3. Attach CV, transcript, and evidence (field/lab data, code, models).
4. Submit per institute instructions; include NOC if asked.
5. Follow up once after 7–10 days with a small improvement.
6. Arrange accommodation and travel post-acceptance.

## Documents Required
- CV (one page)
- Transcript
- Domain SOP/proposal
- NOC/request letter if required
- ID proof, photo

## Competition Level / Acceptance Reality
Moderate to selective depending on institute and mentor capacity. Domain evidence and clear deliverables improve outcomes; generic requests are ignored.

## Past Year Insights (Expected/Indicative)
- Institutes favored domain-aligned artifacts over generic resumes.
- Field-readiness and safety compliance mattered for on-site work.
- Hostel availability was limited; early planning helped.

## FAQs
1) Is the ICAR internship paid?
Expected/Indicative: Some institutes offer stipends; many are certificate-only.

2) Is remote possible?
Generally no; field/lab presence is needed.

3) What CGPA helps?
7.0–8.0+ typical; strong domain proof is key.

4) Do I need a NOC?
Often yes; check institute rules.

5) Can I choose any institute?
Yes, but fit and capacity decide; target 1–2 closely aligned institutes.

6) Is accommodation provided?
Limited; confirm with the host and plan privately if needed.

7) How long is the program?
6–10 weeks typical in summer.

8) Can the internship extend?
Possible with mentor approval and institute permissions.

## Final Advice for Applicants
Target the right institute, show domain artifacts, secure NOC early, and plan housing. Keep SOP concise and deliverable-focused; follow up with tangible improvements.
