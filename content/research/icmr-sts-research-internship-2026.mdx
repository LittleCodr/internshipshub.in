# ICMR Short Term Studentship 2026: Eligibility, Stipend, How to Apply, Dates

## Introduction
ICMR’s Short Term Studentship (STS) funds medical and dental students to conduct guided research projects during summer. This 2026 guide summarizes eligibility, stipend norms (indicative), timelines, and application mechanics. Dates reflect prior cycles—confirm on the official portal.

## About the Organization / Institute
The Indian Council of Medical Research drives biomedical research in India. STS supports early research exposure for MBBS/BDS students under approved faculty guides at recognized institutions.

## Overview of the Research Internship Programme
STS is a 2-month research engagement requiring proposal submission, ethics compliance where applicable, data collection/analysis, and a final report. Stipend is released on successful completion and approval of the report as per ICMR norms.

## Research Domains / Areas Offered
- Clinical research across specialties
- Public health and epidemiology
- Basic/translation science with clinical relevance
- Dental research topics

## Eligibility Criteria
- MBBS/BDS students from MCI/DCI recognized colleges.
- Faculty guide required; guide must meet ICMR eligibility.
- One project per student; ethics approval mandatory for human/animal studies.

## Who Should Apply
Students serious about clinical/public health research who can design a feasible 2-month study with proper approvals. Prior exposure to study design/biostatistics is helpful.

## Stipend & Funding
- Expected/Indicative: STS stipend (~INR 10,000) after report approval as per official norms.
- No separate accommodation/travel support—use home institute resources.

## Duration & Timeline

2. Proposal review for feasibility, ethics, and relevance.
3. Provisional selection subject to approvals.
4. Conduct study, submit midterm (if asked) and final report.
5. Stipend released on approval of report.

## How to Apply (step-by-step)
