## Introduction
IIT Hyderabad attracts summer applicants because its labs blend core engineering with translational work tied to industry and national missions. This playbook focuses on how to win a seat in 2026: where to look, when to outreach, and how to avoid the common mistakes that sink otherwise strong profiles. Any date or stipend notes marked as "Expected / Indicative" mirror recent cycles and help you move early; update your plan when official circulars post.

If you have limited time, prioritize three moves: (1) shortlist labs and write lab-specific pitches; (2) ship one fresh artifact or small reproduction per target lab; (3) prepare logistics (NOC, hostel plan, travel) so you can accept quickly. These three steps alone raise conversion dramatically versus generic CV blasts.

## About the Institute
IIT Hyderabad operates in Hyderabad, Telangana, giving interns access to regional industries and research ecosystems. The campus hosts active centers spanning AI/ML and data science, Semiconductors and VLSI, Robotics and autonomous systems and collaborates with government and industry sponsors. If you are comparing across the IIT system, anchor your choices with the IIT internships hub to see where this institute leads on depth, facilities, and sponsored work.

Because the institute is embedded in Hyderabad, interns can tap into nearby industry partners, field sites, and alumni-led startups. This often translates to problem statements with real datasets or hardware constraints rather than purely academic exercises.

## Overview of Summer Internship Programme 2026
Expect a 6–8 week engagement between mid-May and mid-July. Interns onboard with faculty mentors, align on a scoped problem in week one, and work toward a tangible output (prototype, dataset with analysis, or a technical paper draft). Certificates are standard; credit transfer is rare. High performers sometimes continue as project staff or convert the summer project into a semester-long engagement.

Typical intern experience across IITs: week 1 for scoping and baselines, week 2–5 for build/experiments with weekly demos, and week 6–8 for polish, documentation, and final presentation. Labs expect self-driven progress logs; come with a milestone plan so your mentor can quickly validate feasibility.

## Internship Domains / Research Areas Offered
- AI/ML and data science
- Semiconductors and VLSI
- Robotics and autonomous systems
- Materials and manufacturing
- Sustainable energy and grids
- Bioengineering

How to pick a domain: align with your prior artifacts and a professor’s active grant. Scan recent publications or lab news; if you cannot find a fresh result in the last 12–18 months, pick a different lab to improve responsiveness.

## Eligibility Criteria
- Degree: B.Tech/B.E./B.S./Dual/M.Tech/M.S students from accredited institutes.
- Year: Priority for 3rd/4th year undergraduates and early postgraduates.
- CGPA: Past selections at peer IITs often start near 7.5–8.0+ (Expected/Indicative); faculty flex for standout portfolios.
- Branches: Open across engineering and sciences; individual labs may set prerequisites.
- Nationality: Primarily Indian students; international applicants may be considered via MoUs.
- Availability: Ability to be on campus through May–July 2026; disclose exam windows early.

Competitive differentiators: a coherent theme across 2–3 projects, reproducible results (plots + code), and concise abstracts in your CV. Listing MOOCs without applied work rarely moves the needle.

## Who Should Apply
Apply if you can show alignment to a specific lab in one paragraph: a recent project or artifact, a clear deliverable for 6–8 weeks, and proof you work independently (clean repos, experiment logs, or hardware evidence). Hardware and systems labs value schematics, measurement logs, or CAD/BOM notes; AI/data labs prefer baselines, error analysis, and reproducibility; design/policy labs appreciate user research or field insights.

Signals that help: quantified outcomes (e.g., latency reductions, accuracy deltas, energy measurements), tidy repos with READMEs, and short Loom or YouTube clips for hardware or UX demos. If you lack prior research, a crisp replication of a lab paper with your own ablation is a strong opener.

## Stipend & Benefits
- **Monthly stipend (Expected/Indicative):** Expected: funded through industry and research grants; certificate-only otherwise. Clarify funding early with your mentor.
- **Accommodation:** Paid hostel rooms are typically offered; apply early because summer capacity tightens quickly.
- **Travel reimbursement:** Generally not provided; select industry or sponsored projects may reimburse partially—confirm per project.

If you need funding, state it transparently in your second email after demonstrating fit. Offer a certificate-only fallback so the professor can still proceed if budgets are tight.

## Duration & Important Dates
| Milestone | Expected window (based on peer IIT timelines) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Faculty outreach | Late January to mid-February 2026 | Tailor 6–8 mails; cite lab work directly. |
| Centralized calls (if any) | February 2026 | Department pages may host forms; still do faculty outreach. |
| Rolling confirmations | March 2026 | Reply fast with paperwork; delays hurt conversion. |
| Joining | Mid-May 2026 | Coordinate hostel check-in and ID creation. |
| Program end | Mid to late July 2026 | Plan demo/poster and documentation. |

Contingency planning: if your exam calendar slips, propose an adjusted start by a week but keep the end date. Offering a compressed plan with clear milestones shows respect for lab scheduling.

## Selection Process
1. **Shortlist:** Faculty scan CGPA, transcript fit, and artifacts.
2. **Interaction:** Short call or email thread; some assign a 48–72 hour task.
3. **Offer:** Email confirmation plus likely NOC/bonafide requirement.
4. **Onboarding:** Hostel allocation, campus passes, and lab safety in week one.

Interview prep cues: expect fundamentals (DSA for CS labs, circuits for EE, mechanics/thermo for Mech/Civil), a brief walkthrough of your strongest artifact, and a sanity check on the deliverable you propose. Keep answers concise and quantify results.

## How to Apply
1. **Target labs:** Pick 6–8 labs whose current work matches your skills. Read one recent paper per lab.
2. **Assemble materials:** One-page CV, transcript, 150–200 word SOP per lab, and 2–3 artifact links.
3. **Send focused emails:** 150–200 words, referencing a current problem in the lab and your 6–8 week deliverable.
4. **Monitor portals:** If the institute posts a summer form, submit immediately while continuing faculty outreach.
5. **Follow up:** One concise follow-up after a week, adding new evidence (improved plot, refined schematic, or benchmark).

**Week-by-week plan (expected):**
- Week 1: Choose labs, refresh CV/transcript, and reproduce a small result tied to your top choice.
- Week 2: Send tailored outreach with artifact links; prepare a 3–4 slide mini-brief if requested.
- Week 3: Follow up with incremental improvements; return any assigned task within 72 hours.
- Week 4: Draft NOC, plan hostel logistics, and outline weekly milestones to share post-selection.

Quality bar for outreach emails: 150–200 words, a one-line subject with domain + deliverable, a 2–3 line summary of your best artifact, a 1–2 line proposal for the lab’s current problem, and links (not heavy attachments). Avoid PDF CV attachments in the first mail; use lightweight links unless explicitly requested.

## Documents Required
- CV (one page, quantified outcomes).
- Latest transcript with CGPA and core courses.
- SOP tailored to the lab’s current direction.
- ID proof and recent photograph.
- NOC/bonafide (often requested post-offer).
- Artifact pack: code repos, experiments, schematics, or demo videos relevant to the lab.

Preferred formats: shared repos (GitHub), short slide decks (under 5 MB) when requested, and brief video demos (unlisted links) for hardware or UX work. Keep filenames clean and descriptive.

**SOP elements that work:**
- Open with the lab’s current focus and the exact problem slice you can tackle.
- Specify deliverables and metrics (throughput, accuracy, energy measurements, usability findings) for 6–8 weeks.
- Highlight how you operate: experiment tracking, meeting cadence, and how you will unblock yourself.

## Acceptance Rate / Competition Level
Popular AI/data/robotics labs are heavily contested; unsolicited acceptance can fall below 10%. Niche domains (e.g., AI/ML and data science) may be more accessible if you present direct alignment. Funding availability shifts acceptance dynamics—sponsored projects prefer interns who can commit fully on campus.

**Common pitfalls to avoid:**
- Asking for remote-only work without proposing an initial on-campus phase.
- Sending long CVs without a sharp summary of results and metrics.
- Proposing deliverables unrelated to the lab’s current grants.
- Delaying replies after faculty responses; speed signals seriousness.

## Previous Year Insights (2024/2025)
- Faculty-led approvals dominated across IITs; centralized calls supplemented, not replaced, outreach.
- Certificates were standard; stipends appeared mainly via industry-funded or grant-backed projects.
- Hybrid options occasionally opened after initial on-campus work.
- Candidates who shared a concrete 6–8 week plan with metrics saw higher response rates than broad interest emails.

Peer signals that helped last year: concise experiment logs, reproducibility (requirements.txt/env files), and willingness to align working hours with lab schedules. Candidates who declared their exam windows early faced fewer mid-project disruptions.

## FAQs
### Is the IIT Hyderabad summer internship paid?
Only some seats are funded through sponsored projects; many are certificate-only. Confirm stipend directly with your hosting faculty.

### Can non-IIT students apply?
Yes. Strong CGPA and evidence of fit to the lab’s current work are key selection drivers.

### Will there be a centralized application portal?
Some departments post calls or forms; monitor official pages in February, but do not skip faculty outreach.

### Are hostels available for visiting interns?
Generally yes, on a paid basis. Apply early to secure rooms during peak summer occupancy.

### Can I work remotely?
Remote-only is uncommon. Hybrid may be allowed after initial on-campus alignment, subject to faculty approval.

### What CGPA should I target?
Past selections at peer IITs often considered 7.5–8.0+ (Expected/Indicative), adjusted for project strength and lab fit.

### Do I need an NOC from my college?
Usually requested after selection for campus access and hostel allotment.

### Can the internship extend into a semester project or RA role?
Yes. Strong performers are sometimes invited to continue as project staff or extend work into the semester.

## Final Advice
Lead with precision: cite a lab’s current project, propose a deliverable you can ship in 6–8 weeks, and attach artifacts that prove execution. Be transparent about funding needs but prepared for certificate-only offers. If you secure a slot, lock hostel accommodation early and align on weekly milestones with your mentor.

Keep your emails short, your artifacts sharp, and your timelines realistic. When in doubt, show rather than tell—plots, schematics, and small demos out-convert long prose every time.
