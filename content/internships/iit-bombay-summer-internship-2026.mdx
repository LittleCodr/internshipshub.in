## Introduction
IIT Bombay’s summer internship intake is one of the most sought-after on the Indian academic calendar because of its deep research culture, industry-facing labs in Powai, and a proven pipeline to graduate study and pre-placement interviews. This guide compiles what candidates need to act early: where the 2026 intake is likely to open, how selections typically run, and how to avoid the most common rejections. Any timelines or stipend figures marked as "Expected / Indicative" mirror previous cycles and may shift once official announcements land—treat them as planning guardrails, not certainties.

## About the Institute
IIT Bombay is consistently ranked among India’s top engineering schools and is known for high-output labs in AI/ML, sustainable energy, advanced materials, aerospace systems, and urban tech. Its location inside Mumbai’s startup and financial hub attracts sponsored projects and joint R&D with industry, giving interns hands-on exposure instead of shadow work. For breadth across IITs, see the IIT internships hub for context-rich comparisons.

## Overview of Summer Internship Programme 2026
The summer programme typically runs for 6–8 weeks between mid-May and mid-July. Interns are embedded in faculty labs, receive a scoped project, and work toward a tangible deliverable: a technical report, poster, or proof-of-concept. Mentorship is primarily faculty-led with day-to-day guidance from senior PhD scholars. Credit transfer is rare but certificates are standard; some departments enable project continuation into a B.Tech project or offer an interview slot for research assistant roles. Cohorts are small and lab-driven, so early outreach to the right faculty is the highest-leverage move.

## Internship Domains / Research Areas Offered
- Computer Science: scalable systems, vision and speech, reinforcement learning, trustworthy AI.
- Electrical Engineering: VLSI design, signal processing, power electronics, control systems.
- Mechanical & Aerospace: autonomous vehicles, UAV dynamics, computational fluid dynamics, robotics.
- Civil & Environmental: transportation analytics, structural health monitoring, water resources, climate resilience.
- Chemical & Materials: process intensification, battery tech, composites, polymer engineering, corrosion.
- Energy Science & Engineering: solar PV systems, power grids, storage, carbon capture.
- Interdisciplinary: urban science, biomedical engineering, policy and tech, sustainability analytics.

## Eligibility Criteria
- Degree: B.Tech/B.S/B.E./Dual Degree/M.Tech/M.S students from accredited institutes.
- Year: Strongest consideration for 3rd/4th year undergraduates and 1st year postgraduates.
- CGPA: Prior cycles saw shortlists around 7.5–8.0+ (expected); faculty discretion applies.
- Branches: Open across engineering and sciences; niche labs may specify prerequisites.
- Nationality: Primarily Indian students; visiting international students may be considered via MoUs.
- Prerequisites: Evidence of coursework or mini-projects aligned to the target lab.

## Who Should Apply
Candidates who do well typically show: a coherent theme across projects, one or two deep dives (e.g., a Kaggle model with error analysis or a hardware prototype with measurements), and clear alignment to a faculty member’s current work. If you lack formal research experience, emphasize disciplined execution (clean repos, experiment logs) and relevant open-source contributions. For design- or build-heavy labs, attach schematics or videos instead of only GitHub links.

## Stipend & Benefits
- **Monthly stipend (Expected/Indicative):** Many IIT Bombay summer roles are unfunded; faculty- or project-funded seats may provide INR 8,000–15,000/month. Treat funding as additive rather than guaranteed.
- **Accommodation:** Summer hostel rooms are usually available on a paid basis (per-night charges). Apply early; bookings can close once peak capacity is reached.
- **Travel reimbursement:** Not standard. Externally funded projects or industry collaborations occasionally cover partial travel; confirm directly with your faculty sponsor.

## Duration & Important Dates
| Milestone | Expected window (based on previous years) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Portal or faculty outreach opens | Mid-January to early February 2026 | Start contacting faculty with tailored mails. |
| Priority review | Late February 2026 | Early, complete applications see higher conversion. |
| Rolling decisions | March 2026 | Labs confirm individually; keep communication concise. |
| Joining window | 15 May 2026 (± 1 week) | Coordinate hostel check-in. |
| Program end | Mid-July 2026 | Plan for poster or demo day. |

## Selection Process
1. **Faculty shortlisting:** Initial screening on CGPA, transcript fit, and project alignment.
2. **Technical interaction (if invited):** 20–30 minute call covering fundamentals, prior work, and project scope sanity.
3. **Offer & confirmation:** Labs send email confirmations; you may need to supply an NOC from your home institute.
4. **Onboarding:** Hostel allocation (if availing), campus ID, and lab safety briefings.

## How to Apply
1. **Map labs:** Identify 5–8 target labs aligned to your background. Review recent publications to tailor your pitch.
2. **Prepare collateral:** Concise CV (1 page), unofficial transcript, 150–200 word statement mapping your skills to the lab’s active problems, and links to code/prototypes.
3. **Faculty outreach:** Send short, specific mails (subject: "Summer Internship 2026 – your-branch/your-topic"). Avoid mass mail; address current work.
4. **Portal/form (if opened):** If IIT Bombay activates a centralized form, submit there as well. Otherwise, faculty-led approvals remain the dominant path.
5. **Follow-ups:** One polite follow-up after 7–10 days with any new evidence (e.g., improved results, a benchmark comparison) is appropriate.

**Week-by-week execution plan (expected):**
- Week 1 (mid-Jan): Finalize 6–8 target labs, tighten CV, refresh GitHub/portfolio, and ship one small reproduction or ablation relevant to your top choice.
- Week 2: Send tailored outreach with subject lines that include domain + your deliverable. Prepare a 3–4 slide mini-brief you can attach on request.
- Week 3: Follow up with new evidence (e.g., error analysis, hardware test photos). If you receive a task, return within 72 hours.
- Week 4: Lock paperwork (bonafide/NOC drafts), research hostel options, and document your weekly milestone plan to share once you get a yes.

## Documents Required
- CV (one page, impact-focused).
- Latest transcript with CGPA.
- Statement of Purpose (targeted to lab, not generic).
- ID proof and recent photograph.
- NOC/bonafide from home institute (often requested post-selection).
- Portfolio links or small artifact pack (plots, schematics, demo videos) for build-heavy projects.

**What a strong SOP looks like:**
- 150–200 words tied to one lab; lead with the lab’s current problem statement, then map your skills to their constraints.
- One concrete deliverable you will target in 6–8 weeks (dataset with benchmarks, prototype with measurements, or reproducible repo).
- A short note on how you will handle lab logistics (hardware access, expected blockers) to reduce perceived supervision load.

## Acceptance Rate / Competition Level
Highly competitive. Popular CS/AI labs can receive dozens of requests per week; conversion is often well below 10% for cold outreach. Less saturated domains (civil analytics, certain energy niches) may have better odds if you demonstrate direct relevance. Faculty availability and project funding heavily influence actual acceptance each year.

**Mistakes that reduce conversion:**
- Mass emails without lab-specific context; professors routinely filter these out.
- Attaching oversized portfolios without a 3–4 bullet summary of results and metrics.
- Asking for guaranteed stipends before demonstrating fit; keep funding as a secondary ask unless critical.
- Ignoring prerequisite signals in faculty pages (e.g., prior course demands) and proposing off-track ideas.

## Previous Year Insights (2024/2025)
- Centralized portal activity has varied; faculty-driven intake remained the main channel.
- Funded seats were tied to sponsored projects; most offers were certificate-only with hostel access.
- Hybrid or remote stints were rare and usually extended to returning interns who had already proved fit.
- Early, precise outreach (January) correlated strongly with offers; late blanket emails underperformed.

## FAQs
### Is the IIT Bombay summer internship paid?
Some positions carry stipends when backed by sponsored projects (expected INR 8,000–15,000/month). Many roles are unpaid but provide campus access and mentorship.

### Can non-IIT students apply?
Yes. Strong fits with the lab’s ongoing work and a solid CGPA have been accepted in prior cycles.

### Do I need a professor referral to be considered?
Not mandatory, but a direct, well-researched mail to the right professor is the primary path to selection.

### What CGPA is safe for shortlisting?
Historical shortlists often start around 7.5–8.0+ but vary by lab and applicant strength.

### Are remote internships available?
Rare. IIT Bombay prefers on-campus work for lab access. Hybrid may be considered only after initial on-site alignment.

### Will I get a certificate?
Yes, selected interns receive a completion certificate upon meeting project expectations.

### Can this lead to a PPO or RA position?
Strong performers may be invited to continue as project staff or research assistants; PPOs are uncommon but not impossible.

### How should I follow up if I get no response?
Send one concise follow-up after a week. If no reply, move to the next faculty—avoid spamming the same inbox.

## Final Advice
Start early, shortlist tightly, and send evidence-backed mails. Anchor your pitch to a lab’s current problem statement, not a generic "interested in AI" note. Keep artifacts lightweight (plots, repo links) and show that you can scope and deliver within 6–8 weeks. If you need funding, state it transparently and be ready with a fallback (certificate-only) so you do not lose the offer.
