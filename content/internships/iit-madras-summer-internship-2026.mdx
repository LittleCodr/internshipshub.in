## Introduction
IIT Madras hosts one of India’s most interdisciplinary campuses, blending engineering, data science, sustainability, and deep-tech entrepreneurship through its research park. The summer internship track is prized because interns often work inside active industrial collaborations or translational labs. All dates and stipend cues here are "Expected / Indicative"—they mirror 2024/2025 behavior to help you move before announcements land.

## About the Institute
Located in Chennai’s Taramani ecosystem, IIT Madras routinely tops national rankings and operates India’s first university-based research park. Labs like Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and AI (RBCDSAI), Centre for Innovation (CFI), and advanced manufacturing facilities make IITM attractive to both theory-heavy and build-heavy profiles. Compare the rest of the IIT network at the IIT internships hub to see how Madras differs on depth and industry proximity.

## Overview of Summer Internship Programme 2026
Expect a 6–8 week engagement beginning mid-May. Interns onboard with faculty mentors, receive a scoped project, and iterate through weekly reviews. Deliverables often include a prototype, dataset with analysis, or a technical paper draft. Certificates are routine; credit transfer is rare. High performers may be invited to continue as project staff or to extend their work into a semester project with the same lab.

## Internship Domains / Research Areas Offered
- Data Science & AI: time-series forecasting, trustworthy AI, healthcare analytics, reinforcement learning.
- Electrical & Electronics: power systems, control, embedded systems, IoT hardware, RF and communications.
- Mechanical & Aerospace: autonomous systems, propulsion, composite structures, CFD, robotics.
- Civil & Ocean: smart infrastructure, coastal/ocean engineering, transportation planning, water resources.
- Materials & Metallurgy: additive manufacturing, corrosion, advanced alloys, battery materials.
- Biotechnology & Biosciences: computational biology, bioprocess engineering, medical devices.
- Energy & Sustainability: carbon capture, grid integration, renewables, climate resilience.
- Entrepreneurship & Product: rapid prototyping at CFI, human-centered design sprints, startup collaborations in the research park.

## Eligibility Criteria
- Degree: B.Tech/B.E./Dual/M.Tech/M.S students from accredited institutes.
- Year: Preference for 3rd/4th year undergraduates and early-stage postgraduates.
- CGPA: Prior selections often considered 7.5–8.0+ (expected); labs may flex for exceptional portfolios.
- Branches: Open across engineering and sciences; labs may request specific prerequisites.
- Nationality: Primarily Indian students; international applicants may be considered via MoUs.
- Availability: Ability to be on campus through May–July 2026 is critical; disclose exam clashes up front.

## Who Should Apply
Apply if you can connect your past work to a current IITM lab problem within one paragraph. Hardware-heavy labs respect instrument familiarity and schematics; AI/data labs value clean experiments with baselines and error analysis; product and design efforts want user research or usability evidence. If you rely on public MOOCs, cite where you applied them (mini-projects, repos) rather than listing course completions.

## Stipend & Benefits
- **Monthly stipend (Expected/Indicative):** Grants or sponsored projects may fund select interns; many roles remain certificate-only. Clarify funding early with your mentor.
- **Accommodation:** Paid hostel rooms are usually offered; availability depends on semester occupancy. Apply promptly once you accept.
- **Travel reimbursement:** Generally not provided. Some industry-funded work may reimburse part of travel; confirm per project.

## Duration & Important Dates
| Milestone | Expected window (based on previous years) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Faculty outreach | Late January to mid-February 2026 | Begin with 5–7 labs; tailor each mail. |
| Centralized calls (if any) | February 2026 | Watch IITM site and department pages. |
| Rolling confirmations | March 2026 | Labs confirm individually; reply quickly with paperwork. |
| Joining | Around 18 May 2026 | Coordinate hostel check-in and ID creation. |
| Program end | Mid to late July 2026 | Plan demo/poster and documentation. |

## Selection Process
1. **Shortlist:** Faculty scan CGPA, transcript fit, and project evidence.
2. **Interaction:** Short call or email-based technical check; some labs assign a mini-task.
3. **Offer:** Email confirmation plus potential NOC requirement.
4. **Onboarding:** Hostel allocation, campus passes, and lab safety briefing within the first week.

## How to Apply
1. **Target labs:** Pick 5–8 labs; read recent papers or project pages to cite in outreach.
2. **Assemble materials:** One-page CV, transcript, 150–200 word SOP tailored to a specific problem statement, and 2–3 artifact links.
3. **Send focused emails:** Keep to 150–200 words, referencing the lab’s current work and what you will build in 6–8 weeks.
4. **Monitor portals:** If IIT Madras publishes a summer fellowship form, submit immediately; still proceed with faculty outreach.
5. **Follow up:** One concise follow-up after a week is acceptable; add new evidence rather than repeating the same mail.

**Week-by-week plan (expected):**
- Week 1: Choose 6–8 labs, refresh CV and transcript, and reproduce one small result related to your top-choice lab.
- Week 2: Send tailored outreach with a 150–200 word pitch and links to 2–3 artifacts. Prepare a 3–4 slide mini-brief if asked.
- Week 3: Follow up with incremental improvements (new plot, refined schematic, or benchmark). Submit any assigned task within 72 hours.
- Week 4: Draft NOC, plan hostel logistics, and outline weekly milestones to share post-selection.

## Documents Required
- CV (one page, quantified outcomes).
- Latest transcript with CGPA and core courses.
- SOP matched to the lab’s current direction.
- ID proof and recent photograph.
- NOC/bonafide (often requested post-offer).
- Artifact pack: code repos, experiments, schematics, or demo videos relevant to the lab.

**SOP elements that work:**
- Open with the lab’s current focus and the exact problem slice you can tackle.
- Specify deliverables and metrics (throughput, accuracy, energy measurements, usability findings) for 6–8 weeks.
- Highlight how you operate: experiment tracking, meeting cadence, and how you will unblock yourself.

## Acceptance Rate / Competition Level
Popular AI/data and robotics labs are heavily contested; unsolicited acceptance can fall below 10%. Labs in ocean engineering, certain materials domains, or sustainability can be more accessible if you present direct alignment. Funding availability shifts acceptance dynamics—sponsored projects may prefer interns who can commit to full on-campus presence.

**Common pitfalls to avoid:**
- Asking for remote-only work without proposing an initial on-campus phase for lab onboarding.
- Sending long CVs without a sharp summary of results and metrics.
- Proposing deliverables unrelated to the lab’s current grants or problem statements.
- Delaying replies after a faculty response; speed signals seriousness.

## Previous Year Insights (2024/2025)
- Faculty-led approvals dominated; centralized calls supplemented but did not replace direct outreach.
- Certificates were standard; stipends appeared mainly via industry-funded or grant-backed projects.
- Hybrid options occasionally opened for returning interns after initial on-campus work.
- Candidates who shared a concrete 6–8 week plan (milestones, evaluation metrics) saw higher response rates than broad interest emails.

## FAQs
### Is the IIT Madras summer internship paid?
Only some seats are funded through sponsored projects; many are certificate-only. Confirm stipend directly with your hosting faculty.

### Can non-IIT students apply?
Yes. Strong CGPA and evidence of fit to the lab’s current work are key selection drivers.

### Will there be a centralized application portal?
IIT Madras sometimes releases department-specific calls. Monitor official pages in February, but do not skip faculty outreach.

### Are hostels available for visiting interns?
Generally yes, on a paid basis. Apply early to secure rooms during peak summer occupancy.

### Can I work remotely?
Remote-only is uncommon. Hybrid may be allowed after initial on-campus alignment, subject to faculty approval.

### What CGPA should I target?
Past selections often considered 7.5–8.0+ (expected), adjusted for project strength and lab fit.

### Do I need an NOC from my college?
Usually requested after selection for campus access and hostel allotment.

### Can the internship extend into a semester project or RA role?
Yes. Strong performers are sometimes invited to continue as project staff or extend work into the semester.

## Final Advice
Lead with precision: cite a lab’s current project, propose a deliverable you can ship in 6–8 weeks, and attach artifacts that prove you can execute. Be transparent about funding needs but prepared for certificate-only offers. If you secure a slot, lock hostel accommodation early and align on weekly milestones with your mentor.
