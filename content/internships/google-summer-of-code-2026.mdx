# Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2026: Remote Open-Source Internship

## Introduction
GSoC is a remote, stipend-paid program where contributors ship production code for open-source organizations. This 2026 guide covers eligibility, timeline, and proposal strategy. Dates are Expected/Indicative until Google confirms the official calendar.

## About the Program
GSoC pairs accepted contributors with mentors from participating open-source orgs. Work is fully remote. Deliverables are scoped as production features or tools with clear milestones and evaluations.

## Overview of the Internship
Engagements typically run 10–12 weeks with flexible hours agreed between you and mentors. Participants complete a proposal, coding period milestones, midterm and final evaluations, and documentation.

## Domains / Projects Offered
- Systems, compilers, and developer tools
- Web, mobile, and backend frameworks
- Data, ML, and scientific computing
- Security, privacy, observability
- DevOps, infra-as-code, and CI/CD

## Eligibility Criteria
- Meet GSoC student/beginner rules and age/identity verification
- Available for remote work during the coding period
- Technical fit with chosen org and project

## Who Should Apply
Candidates with OSS commits, personal projects, or coursework projects that show code quality, reviews, and issue tracking. Strong fit if you can write clear proposals and collaborate asynchronously.

## Stipend & Funding
- Paid; varies by country band (Expected/Indicative based on prior cycles)
- Disbursed in tranches after evaluations
- No application fee

## Duration & Timeline (Expected/Indicative)
- Org list announcement: Feb 2026
- Applications open: Mar 2026
- Proposal deadline: 2026-04-02
- Coding starts: 2026-05-13 (flexible start)
- Midterm evaluation: late June 2026
- Final evaluation: 2026-09-01 window

## Selection Process
1. Pick an org and project idea; engage on issues/discussions.
2. Draft proposal with milestones, risks, and communication plan.
3. Submit via the GSoC portal before deadline.
4. Orgs review proposals, prior contributions, and communication history.
5. Accepted contributors finalize milestones with mentors.

## How to Apply (step-by-step)
1. Shortlist 2–3 orgs; read project ideas and repos.
2. Make small contributions (issues, PRs, docs) to show fit.
3. Write a 2–4 page proposal with weekly milestones and success metrics.
4. Get mentor feedback on the draft where possible.
5. Submit on the portal; keep contributing while waiting.

## Documents Required
- Government ID for verification
- Proposal PDF
- Links to contributions/repos
- Resume (concise)

## Competition Level / Acceptance Reality
Highly selective; acceptance varies by org and mentor bandwidth. Prior contributions and crisp proposals drive selection more than grades.

## Past Year Insights (Expected/Indicative)
- Contributors who merged PRs before applying converted best.
- Clear risk/mitigation sections improved mentor confidence.
- Async communication discipline mattered for remote success.

## FAQs
1) Is GSoC paid?
Yes, stipends are paid in bands by country; verify official amounts.

2) Do I need prior OSS experience?
Helpful but not mandatory; small contributions before applying are strongly recommended.

3) Can I participate while employed?
Check GSoC rules; typically intended for students/beginners able to commit to the schedule.

4) How many projects can I submit?
You can submit multiple proposals to different orgs; only one can be accepted.

5) Is the work fully remote?
Yes, the program is remote and async.

6) What is the weekly time commitment?
Varies by project; discuss with mentors. Expect part-time to full-time.

7) What happens if I miss a milestone?
Mentors can fail an evaluation; communicate early and adjust scope.

8) How do I improve my chances?
Ship small PRs, ask focused questions, and present a realistic, milestone-driven proposal.

## Final Advice
Engage early with orgs, ship small contributions, and craft a specific proposal with milestones and risks. Keep communication concise and asynchronous. Plan your summer calendar to avoid conflicts with exams or travel.
