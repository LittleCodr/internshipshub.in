## Introduction
IIT Delhi’s summer intake is prized for its proximity to policy circles, industry labs, and national research centers in the NCR. The 2026 cohort will again be faculty-driven, with select centralized forms appearing for specific departments. Treat every date and stipend figure noted here as "Expected / Indicative"—they mirror 2024/2025 patterns and help you plan outreach before official circulars arrive.

## About the Institute
Situated in Hauz Khas, IIT Delhi consistently ranks at the top for engineering and design education, backed by centers such as CARE (AI/ML), Kusuma School of Biological Sciences, and Bharti School of Telecom. Its industrial research park and startup culture mean interns often see live deployments rather than academic-only prototypes. For a macro view, compare peers at the IIT internships hub to understand where Delhi stands on domains and funding.

## Overview of Summer Internship Programme 2026
Expect a 6–8 week program anchored by faculty-led projects across engineering, design, applied sciences, and policy-tech. Interns typically start in late May, spend the first week aligning scope, and then build toward a working demo or technical note. Certificates are standard; credit transfer is uncommon. Labs sometimes extend offers into semester-long projects or paid research assistantships for strong performers.

## Internship Domains / Research Areas Offered
- Computer Science & AI: trustworthy AI, language and vision models, distributed systems, formal methods.
- Electrical & Communication: RF systems, 5G/6G testbeds, signal processing, VLSI, embedded hardware.
- Mechanical & Design: robotics, haptics, additive manufacturing, biomechanics, human-centered product design.
- Civil & Environmental: smart infrastructure, transportation analytics, hydrology, air quality modeling.
- Chemical & Materials: process simulation, membranes, energy materials, polymer engineering.
- Textile & Fibre: smart textiles, composites, functional materials.
- Biotechnology & Bioinformatics: biomaterials, computational genomics, medical devices.

## Eligibility Criteria
- Degree: B.Tech/B.E./B.S./Dual/M.Tech/M.S students from accredited institutions.
- Year: Priority for 3rd/4th year undergraduates; competitive PG students welcome.
- CGPA: Past shortlists often start near 8.0 (expected) but vary by lab and evidence of fit.
- Branches: Wide open; certain labs insist on prerequisites (e.g., signals, probability, mechanics).
- Nationality: Primarily Indian students; international applicants may be considered via MoUs or exchange.
- Additional filters: Prior project alignment carries more weight than generic achievements.

## Who Should Apply
Apply if you can show relevance to an IIT Delhi lab in one email: recent coursework, a portfolio artifact with results, and a clear statement of what you will build in 6–8 weeks. Policy-tech and design labs appreciate user research or field-study evidence; systems and hardware labs look for reproducible experiments or schematics. If your college calendar clashes, clarify availability up front to avoid last-minute drops.

## Stipend & Benefits
- **Monthly stipend (Expected/Indicative):** Limited funded slots tied to sponsored projects; many offers are certificate-only. Do not assume stipend unless the faculty confirms.
- **Accommodation:** Paid hostel rooms are usually offered to visiting interns; apply early because summer occupancy is high.
- **Travel reimbursement:** Rare. Occasionally provided when work is funded by industry or government grants; confirm case by case.

## Duration & Important Dates
| Milestone | Expected window (based on previous years) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Faculty outreach recommended | Early February 2026 | Map labs before mid-semester rush. |
| Centralized form (if released) | Mid-February to early March 2026 | Historically opened for select departments. |
| Rolling selections | March 2026 | Individual labs confirm via email. |
| Joining | Around 20 May 2026 | Coordinate hostel check-in and campus passes. |
| Program end | Mid to late July 2026 | Plan deliverable submissions. |

## Selection Process
1. **Initial screen:** Faculty assess CGPA, transcript depth, and project alignment.
2. **Technical interaction:** Short call or email thread to validate readiness; some labs may assign a mini-task.
3. **Offer & paperwork:** Confirmation email plus potential NOC requirement from home institute.
4. **Onboarding:** Hostel allocation and lab orientation; ID creation typically handled within the first week.

## How to Apply
1. **Identify faculty:** Shortlist 6–8 professors whose current work matches your skills. Read 1–2 recent papers to reference in your pitch.
2. **Prepare dossier:** One-page CV, transcript, concise SOP (150–200 words), and links to 2–3 strongest artifacts.
3. **Send tailored outreach:** Use precise subject lines and call out alignment to the faculty’s ongoing projects. Avoid broad mass emails.
4. **Watch for forms:** Some departments post a Google Form or portal on the IIT Delhi site. Submit there as well to stay on record.
5. **Follow-up cadence:** One follow-up after a week is reasonable. Keep messages short and add new evidence (improved results, small prototype).

**Week-by-week action map (expected):**
- Week 1: Shortlist 6–8 labs, draft a 150–200 word pitch per lab, and ready a one-page CV + transcript pack.
- Week 2: Send tailored outreach; for policy/design labs, attach a 2-slide user insight or field-study summary.
- Week 3: Follow up with a small improvement (benchmark delta, better visualization, refined schematic). Return any faculty task within 72 hours.
- Week 4: Prepare NOC drafts, hostel planning, and a week-by-week milestone sheet to share once selected.

## Documents Required
- CV (impact-focused, one page).
- Latest transcript with CGPA and key courses.
- SOP customized to the lab’s current work.
- ID proof and recent passport photograph.
- NOC/bonafide (often requested after offer acceptance).
- Artifact pack (code links, schematics, or design case studies) tailored to the target lab.

**SOP pointers that resonate:**
- Anchor on one lab problem, not a broad interest area. Cite a recent paper or project page from that lab.
- Declare a feasible 6–8 week deliverable with how you will measure success (metrics, tests, or user insights).
- State how you will operate independently (experiment logging, weekly demos) to reduce supervision load.

## Acceptance Rate / Competition Level
IIT Delhi receives heavy inbound for CS/AI/communications labs; acceptance there can dip below 10% for unsolicited emails. Less crowded areas (textiles, some civil sub-domains) are relatively more accessible if you present direct relevance. Funding availability and lab bandwidth influence final numbers each year.

**Avoid these blockers:**
- Generic CV blasts without lab-specific anchoring.
- Overpromising (e.g., "will deliver a published paper") without a realistic plan for 6–8 weeks.
- Sending large attachments instead of concise links; many faculty skim emails on mobile.
- Not declaring availability or exam windows, leading to timing conflicts late in the process.

## Previous Year Insights (2024/2025)
- Most offers remained faculty-driven; centralized forms supplemented, not replaced, professor approvals.
- Certificates were standard; stipends appeared mainly where grants existed.
- Hybrid arrangements were occasionally allowed after an initial on-campus phase.
- Early, precise outreach with a clear build plan saw much higher responses than generic CV blasts.

## FAQs
### Is the IIT Delhi summer internship paid?
Some seats are funded through sponsored projects, but many offers are certificate-only. Confirm stipend directly with the hosting faculty.

### Can non-IIT students apply?
Yes. Strong academic records and aligned project work are more important than institute tag.

### What CGPA improves my chances?
Past shortlists often started near 8.0 (expected), but compelling project fit can offset slightly lower scores.

### Are hostels available for interns?
Typically yes, on a paid basis. Apply early to secure a room during peak summer occupancy.

### Will there be a centralized application form?
Some departments release a form each year; others rely solely on faculty outreach. Monitor the IIT Delhi site in February.

### Can I work remotely?
Remote-only is uncommon. Hybrid may be considered after an initial on-campus onboarding for suitable projects.

### Do I need an NOC from my college?
Most labs will request a bonafide or NOC after selection, especially for campus access and hostel allotment.

### Can the internship convert to an RA or extended project?
Yes. High-performing interns sometimes continue as project staff or extend into semester projects with the same lab.

## Final Advice
Lead with fit, not with volume. One crisp, evidence-backed mail to the right professor beats twenty generic mails. Share artifacts that prove you can deliver within 6–8 weeks, and be transparent about funding needs. If you want a stipend, ask early but keep a certificate-only fallback so you do not lose momentum.
