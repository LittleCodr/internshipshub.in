## What you'll work on

- Instrument product funnels across Razorpay Payments, X, and Capital.
- Ship dashboards and cohort analyses to surface conversion drop-offs.
- Collaborate with product managers and growth marketers to design experiments.

## What Razorpay expects

- Comfort with SQL joins, window functions, and building reproducible data pipelines.
- Ability to translate ambiguous product problems into measurable metrics.
- Exposure to Python or R for quick experimentation.

## Selection process timeline

1. Resume screening with emphasis on analytics internships or projects.
2. Case-based product analytics assignment (SQL + experimentation).
3. Final round with product and growth leaders.

## Why this internship matters

The product analytics pod drives monetization for Razorpay's core products. Interns shadow senior analysts, get real ownership on weekly experiments, and plug directly into Razorpay's product roadmap. High performers convert to PPO offers with Level-1 product analytics roles.
