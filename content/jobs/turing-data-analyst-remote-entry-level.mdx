## What you will work on

- Build and maintain dashboards for product adoption, funnel health, and retention for remote-first client teams.
- Write SQL to investigate anomalies, instrument new events, and deliver decision-ready insights.
- Partner with PMs/engineers on experiment design, guardrail metrics, and post-experiment readouts.

## What makes you a fit

1. Hands-on SQL with clean joins, window functions, and data validation.
2. Experience in one BI tool (Looker/Tableau/Power BI) and comfort in Python/R for quick analysis.
3. Bias for async communication, crisp documentation, and working across time zones.

## Interview stages

- Recruiter screen on remote-readiness and basics.
- Technical round: SQL/analytics challenge + visualization discussion.
- Panel with PM/Eng for product sense and communication.
- Culture add conversation; offer with compensation details.

Remote setup tips: prepare stable internet, a quiet workspace, and sample dashboards/queries to discuss. Keep your portfolio links handy during calls.
