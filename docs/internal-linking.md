# Internal Linking Pattern for Institute Internship Articles

- **Category hubs:** Link to `/internships/iit-internships/`, `/internships/nit-internships/`, and `/internships/iiit-internships/` with descriptive anchors (e.g., "IIT internships hub"). Ensure these hubs exist before publishing batches.
- **Peer cross-links:** Within each institute article, add 2–3 links to nearest peer institutes (geography or reputation) using descriptive anchors, not "click here". Example: "Compare metro peers via IIT Delhi Summer Internship 2026".
- **Related Internships block:** Place near the end of each article with 2–3 bullet links plus the relevant category hub. Keep anchor text action-led ("See western India benchmarks at …").
- **Contextual anchors:** When mentioning domains or selection nuances, link to other articles that provide contrast (e.g., funding differences between IIT Bombay and IIT Madras) to distribute authority.
- **Slug standard:** `{institute}-summer-internship-2026` under `/internships/` for all IIT/NIT/IIIT pages. Use the same slug in the canonical URL, JSON-LD, and OG image filename.
- **Avoid orphaned links:** Every new article should link out to at least two existing institute pages and one hub; update earlier articles to point to new ones as batches roll out.
